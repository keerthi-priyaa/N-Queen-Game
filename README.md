# N-Queen Game
N-Queen game is designed using N-queen problem in Backtracking in Java. In this project the user is asked to enter a value greater than or equal to four. Then it displays a frame with NxN buttons placed on a buttonpane. There is a toppane which consists of three buttons.They are 1)Newgame button which displays a new frame and ready to take new input from user. 2)Exit button which exits game. 3)Solution button which displays a solution which is close to the input. The input is to place the given N queens on the buttons pane from left. The user need to place the queens so that the queen in a row, column and diagonal have no clashes with other queens. The queens are represented with green color and the clashes with red color. If the user is successful to place all the N queens without any clashes. Then there is message box displays that he won the game. Else the user can view the solution when the solution button is pressed.

When the user didnâ€™t place the queens correctly then he end up with all the clashes on the board. And the solution is displayed on the console when the Solution button is pressed. When displaying the solution it uses backtracking to place the queen to give the optimization solution. Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.
